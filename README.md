## Overview
The primary goal of this research is to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for specific programming tasks, such as code synthesis and self-debugging. This involves fine-tuning an advanced LLM to achieve high proficiency in generating and debugging code autonomously, incorporating agentic features that enable the model to perform tasks with minimal human intervention

# **Project Setup:**
To use GemmaDev in your projects, follow these simple steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Aryan-Deshpande/GemmaDev
```

```sh
cd automation
# GemmaDev works in a single folder context, make sure to copy these files into the specfic directory you need
sage.sh
t_actual_inference.py
track.py
```

```sh
# For now manually enter the python file to debug in sage.sh, eg:
PYTHON_FILE="x.py" 
# Depending on your os platform run the bash script sage.sh, for windows:
bash sage.sh
```

```
Your Code Should Now Fix Itself :)
```

## Frontend Setup
```sh
