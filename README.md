## Overview

Code-Gemma is a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on the state-of-the-art Gemma by Google. This project focuses on leveraging advanced fine-tuning techniques, including Supervised Fine-tuning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning using LoRA (Logical Reasoning Augmentation) and QLoRA (Quantum Logical Reasoning Augmentation). The primary objective is to enhance Gemma's understanding of grounded logic in programming languages and their associated problem-solving scenarios.

## Fine-Tuning techniques utilized

- **Supervised Fine-tuning:** Code-Gemma undergoes a rigorous supervised fine-tuning process to learn the nuances and intricacies of various programming languages. This ensures a solid foundation for understanding and generating code snippets.

- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning:** The utilization of LoRA and QLoRA allows Code-Gemma to efficiently adapt to different programming paradigms and problem-solving domains. This fine-tuning approach enhances the model's logical reasoning capabilities, making it adept at tackling complex programming challenges.

- **Grounded Logic Understanding:** Code-Gemma aims to bridge the gap between natural language understanding and the grounded logic of programming languages. The model is trained to comprehend the context-specific logic inherent in coding tasks, enabling more accurate and context-aware code generation.
